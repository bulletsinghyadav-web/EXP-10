1. 🎯 Introduction & Objective
Problem
Manual tracking of hostel admissions, room assignments, and student issues is inefficient, time-consuming, and prone to human error. Administrators lack a central, reliable way to view current occupancy or address student needs quickly.

Solution
A lightweight, web-based Student Hostel Management System (SHMS) built with Spring Boot. This system will digitize the core administrative tasks, providing a single source of truth for student records, room status, and complaints.

Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to build a functional, beginner-friendly Spring Boot application that demonstrates mastery of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. It will focus on fundamental CRUD (Create, Read) operations.

2. 👥 User Personas
Hostel Admin (Primary User):

Who: The hostel warden or administrator.

Needs: Wants to register new students, assign them to rooms, and see a list of all students and their assigned rooms. They also need to review student-submitted complaints.

Goal: A simple, all-in-one dashboard to manage daily hostel operations.

Student (Secondary User):

Who: Any student residing in the hostel.

Needs: A quick and easy way to report a problem (e.g., "broken light," "no hot water") to the admin.

Goal: To submit a complaint without needing to find the admin in person.

3. 📋 Functional Requirements (Core Features)
This project is scoped to four key features.

Feature 1: Student Admission Management
Description: The core system for adding and viewing student records.

User Stories:

"As an Admin, I want to access a form to register a new student so I can add them to the system."

"As an Admin, I want to see a list of all registered students and their details (including their assigned room) on one page."

Requirements:

A web page (/students/new) with an HTML form to create a new Student.

The Student model must include fields for: fullName, email, phoneNumber, guardianName.

Submitting the form saves the new student to the database.

A web page (/students) that displays all students from the database in an HTML table.

Feature 2: Room Inventory & Allocation
Description: Managing the hostel's room inventory and assigning students to rooms.

User Stories:

"As an Admin, I want to add new rooms to the hostel system so they become available for allocation."

"As an Admin, I want to see a list of all rooms and their current status ('Vacant' or 'Occupied')."

"As an Admin, I want to assign a 'Vacant' room to a student who does not yet have one."

Requirements:

A simple form (/rooms/new) to create a new Room.

The Room model must include fields for: roomNumber (e.g., "101A") and status ("Vacant" / "Occupied").

A page (/rooms) to display all rooms and their status.

A dedicated "Allocation" page (/allocate):

This page will show two dropdown menus:

A list of students who do not have a room.

A list of rooms with the status "Vacant."

A "Assign" button will link the student to the room, update the Room status to "Occupied," and save this relationship.

Feature 3: Complaint Handling
Description: A simple system for students to submit complaints and for admins to review them.

User Stories:

"As a Student, I want to fill out a simple form to submit a maintenance or food complaint."

"As an Admin, I want to see a list of all submitted complaints in one place."

Requirements:

A public web page (/complaint) with a form.

The Complaint model must include fields for: studentName, roomNumber, and complaintDetails (a text area).

Submitting the form saves the complaint to the database.

An admin-only page (/admin/complaints) that displays all submitted complaints in a list or table.

Feature 4: Admin Dashboard
Description: A central navigation hub for the admin.

User Stories:

"As an Admin, when I first open the application, I want a simple home page that links to all my main tasks."

Requirements:

A homepage (/admin or /) that acts as the main dashboard.

This page will contain links (styled as buttons or text):

"Register New Student"

"View All Students"

"View All Rooms"

"Allocate Room"

"View Complaints"

4. ⚙️ Non-Functional Requirements
Technology Stack:

Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Web (MVC)

Frontend: Thymeleaf (for HTML templating)

Database: H2 In-Memory Database (data will reset every time the application restarts)

Data Access: Spring Data JPA

Build Tool: Maven

User Interface: The UI must be clean, simple, and functional. No complex styling (CSS) is required; standard HTML5 is acceptable.

Security: This project has no user authentication (login/password). All admin pages are considered "public" for this beginner scope.

5. ❌ Out of Scope (Future Work)
The following features will not be implemented in this version:

User login/password or role-based access (e.g., ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_STUDENT).

Fee and billing management.

Attendance tracking.

Editing or Deleting existing student or room records (this version focuses only on Create and Read).

Marking complaints as "Resolved."

Advanced reporting or analytics.
